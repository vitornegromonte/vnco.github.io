We developed a CNN-based approach for detecting Parkinson's disease at various stages using images of spirals drawn on paper. The spirals, which reflect motor control abilities, are processed to identify patterns indicative of Parkinsonâ€™s progression, providing a non-invasive and efficient diagnostic tool. By leveraging convolutional neural networks, our model aims to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's, analyzing subtle variations in the spiral drawings that correspond to the severity of the disease.

Our model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset by approximately 10%, achieving an impressive **95%** accuracy. This significant improvement demonstrates the potential of using CNNs for early and accurate detection of Parkinson's disease through non-invasive methods. As a result, we were invited to present a keynote at one of the largest tech conferences in Brazil, [Campus Party Nordeste](https://brasil.campus-party.org/cpnordeste/). Our presentation was the most attended session on that stage throughout the event, highlighting the impact and interest in our work.
