title: About me
---

Undergraduate Statistics student at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), with a focus on machine learning and model optimization. During my studies, I served as a teaching assistant in two courses: **Computational Creativity** (focused on exploring AI as a tool to help humans enhance their creativity) and **Introduction to Deep Learning**, working with professors [Filipe Calegario](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=nTAKxd0AAAAJ) and [Tsang Ing Ren](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=TdlHZ0kAAAAJ), respectively.

In my sophomore year, I joined the [National Institute of Software Engineering](https://ines.org.br/) as a junior researcher, conducting research in Human-Computer Interaction within the [Smart Cities and Internet of Things](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~sciot/), under the guidance of professor [Kiev Gama](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ZRq_UfUAAAAJ) and co-advised by [Ana Paula Chaves](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=mwtBVQsAAAAJ) from [Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/).

I am a co-founder and researcher at the [Geraia](instagram.com/geraiaverso) research group, working with professors [Filipe Calegario](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=nTAKxd0AAAAJ), [Giordano Cabral](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=tQH3k5gAAAAJ), and [Andr√© Neves](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sadIWEUAAAAJ). At Geraia, I am *currently* conducting research in Generative AI, focusing on the evaluation and optimization of Language Models (LLMs) in Portuguese and retrieval algorithms.

I also co-founded the Artificial Intelligence League of the Federal University of Pernambuco, also known as *LIGIA*, which is linked to the [CIn.AI](https://ai.cin.ufpe.br/) group, a pioneering AI research group in Brazil founded in the 1970s. As **Outreach Director** of *LIGIA*, my main responsibilities include forming partnerships with other groups, companies, and governmental organizations, organizing events to showcase the use of AI in various fields (such as finance, healthcare, and more), and preparing educational materials to teach AI to the broader community.

During this time, I also co-founded a start-up called [Redduo.ai](https://www.redduo.ai/) and served as Chief Data Officer/co-Chief Technology Officer, but left before the first year of its founding.
