Lecture delivered at the 1st seminar of the Artificial Intelligence Academic League of the Federal University of Pernambuco ([LIGIA-UFPE](https://www.instagram.com/ligia.ufpe/)).

The central theme was to introduce the field of Generative AI to the general public, using text generation models such as BERT, GPT, and LLama to explain these concepts.

The objective was to keep the approach as simple as possible, avoiding delving into complex mathematical content to make the knowledge accessible not only to the academic community but to anyone interested in the subject.
